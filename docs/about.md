My name is Mike and I've worked as a Network and Systems Administrator for 10 years mostly in the higherEd space. I am definitely a jack-of-all trades sort with experience in Windows and Linux server administration, network administration with Juniper and Aruba products, telecom with Skype for Business and Teams, and cloud with AWS and Azure. At this point in my career it's time to focus on a subset of these and I've decided on cloud first on Linux, but that isn't to say I won't be working with Microsoft products or digging deeper into networking. I'll also be spending a lot of time with Python to try and breakthrough the "learning Python" phase and into writing Python on the job.

I am also interested in providing sysadmin services on a volunteer basis for good causes. Feel free to reach out -- mikebmott@pm.me.
