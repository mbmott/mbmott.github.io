I'll be using this blog to document how I learn different technologies that are mostly related to work as a sysadmin. I'll begin by introducing the tech, followed by the resources used to learn, and will finish with a small demo project. In the past I haven't really taken notes and have regretted that each time.

Planned: 

Ansible
Ansible and AWS
Vagrant
Studying for the Azure 300 and 301 exams.
My home Ubiquiti network
Automating with Python
